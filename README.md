## QuickMart_Software_Engineering
A warehouse-to-customer grocery delivery system design focused on SDLC phases, SRS documentation, and UML modeling.

## 📌 Project Overview
QuickMart is a comprehensive software engineering conceptual project developed for the **CS383** course. The project applies the **Waterfall Model** to design a structured and scalable grocery delivery system, moving from detailed requirements gathering to system modeling using UML diagrams.

## 👥 Team Collaboration
This project was a collaborative effort by a team of 9 students. As the **Group Leader**, I managed the team's progress, coordinated meetings, and ensured the consistency of the final deliverables.

## 🔑 My Key Contributions
In addition to project management, I was specifically responsible for:
* **Software Requirements Specification (SRS):** Developed the Requirements Engineering Plan, including gathering methods, analysis approach, and validation (Part D).
* **UML Modeling:** Designed the **Use Case Diagram** to illustrate actor interactions (Customer, Admin, Driver) with the system.
* **Process Selection:** Justified and documented the use of the **Waterfall Model** for this standardized grocery workflow.
* **System Design (SDD):** Contributed to the architectural design and structural modeling of the application.

## 🛠 Engineering Concepts Applied
* **Software Process Models:** Detailed application of the Waterfall lifecycle.
* **System Modeling (SDD):** System Architecture, Activity, Sequence, State, and Class Diagrams.
* **Ethics & Responsibility:** Applied ACM/IEEE Software Engineering Code of Ethics to the system design.

## 📂 Deliverables
* **[Full Technical Report](./QuickMart_Software_Engineering_Report.pdf):** A 30-page document covering SRS, SDD, and Project Management.
